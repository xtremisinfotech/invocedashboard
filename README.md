# Stripe Invoice Dashboard UI - Laravel & Livewire

This project recreates a simplified version of the Stripe Invoice Dashboard UI using **Laravel**, **Livewire**, and **TailwindCSS**. The dashboard features tabs for filtering invoices, a table with dynamic rows, and a dropdown for each invoice. Itâ€™s designed to be responsive on desktop screens.

## Features
- **Tabs with Filtering**: Implement clickable tabs (All invoices, Draft, Outstanding, Paid) that filter the table rows dynamically using Livewire.
- **Invoice Table**: A table with the following columns:
  - Amount
  - Invoice Number
  - Customer Email
  - Status (e.g., Draft, Paid) with colored labels.
  - Created Date
- **Dynamic Dropdown**: A dropdown menu for each row that shows placeholder like Download, Delete.
- **Styling**: TailwindCSS for styling, replicating the look and feel of Stripe's invoice dashboard.
- **Responsive Design**: The layout is optimized for desktop view.

### Features Implementation

1. **Livewire Filtering**:
    - Tabs (All invoices, Draft, Outstanding, Paid) are implemented using **Livewire** components for dynamic content updates.
    - Filter invoices by their status with Livewire-powered filtering.

2. **Invoice Table**:
    - The table rows are populated with seeder invoice data (30 rows).
    - The table includes the following columns:
        - Amount
        - Invoice Number
        - Customer Email
        - Status (Draft, Paid) with color-coded labels
        - Created Date

3. **Dynamic Dropdown**:
    - Each row in the table has a dropdown with placeholder options (Download, Delete).
    - The dropdown is implemented using **Livewire** to toggle the visibility dynamically.

4. **Styling**:
    - TailwindCSS is used for styling. The project is built to resemble the Stripe Invoice Dashboard UI as closely as possible.

5. **Responsive Design**:
    - The layout is designed to be responsive on desktop devices. (Mobile responsiveness is not implemented fully it can be viewed in mobile though).

### Export Action (New Feature)
